        <h3>About Me</h3>
        <p>I am a full stack developer with a background in education and logistics. Through my years managing a shipping department and a classroom, I have developed invaluable skills in problem solving, collaboration, and making deadlines. I've worked with people of all different types in order to get things done well and on time - truck drivers, port managers, students, parents, teachers, and administrators. Working together toward a common goal is how great things happen, and I am looking forward to being part of a new team.</p>
